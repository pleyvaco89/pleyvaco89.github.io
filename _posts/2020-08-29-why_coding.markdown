Because there is freedom in it. The world continues to transform, and, in my opinion, our field, more than any other, is a catalyst for its change. Things that were once outside of our domain, we can now endeavor to bring to heel. The ability to sit down, twist some notion in your head into laws of logic, and then have it be obeyed in the real world is intensely gratifying. 

I never had the opportunity or means to pursue software engineering when I was younger, as work trumped over going to school. Now, at 31, I am in a place in my life where I am finally able to pursue what I've always been interested in. Having said that, I am happy to have chosen Flatiron to take those next steps.
